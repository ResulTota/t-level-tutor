        <h3 id="what-section">What Is It?</h3>
        <p> Task 3 is all about making Flow Charts.
            <br> You will be given a brief and a CSV file that your Flow Chart(s) will be based on.

            <h4 id="CSV Files">CSV Files</h4>
            &ensp; <em>What are CSV files..?</em>
            <br><br> A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file is a plain text file that contains data in a tabular format.
            <br> Each line in the file represents a row of data, and each value within the row is separated by a comma.
            <br> <br> Within the ESP, the CSV file will contain data relevant to the brief.
            <br> &emsp; <em><strong>Note:</strong> You <strong>will not</strong> recieve the same CSV file in Task 4a, however it is <strong>highly</strong> likely that the CSV file will have <strong>similar</strong> data </em>
                <br> <br> <strong><em>Here is an example of an ESP CSV File:</em></strong>
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; <img src="../../../images/csv-file-example-3.png" alt="Example csv file" width="600"/>
                <br> <strong>key features:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Almost every CSV file you will be given will have a form of Time 
                        <br> &ensp; <em><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a guarantee.. it is just <strong> highly likely.</strong></em> </li>
                    <li> There are several collums with unique headers </li>  
                    <li> Each Value (outside of Day) is unique </li>
                </ul>
                You will use this data to create your Flow Chart(s), as you will need to reference the data in the CSV file to meets the brief requirements.
            <br>
            
            <h4 id="Flow Charts">Flow Charts</h4>
            &ensp; <em>Soooo... What are Flow Charts..?</em>
            <br><br> A flow chart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm.
            <br> Flowcharts can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate complex ideas in a simple, graphical way.
                        <br> &ensp; <em>(They can act as a bridge between a programmer and a client, too ensure everyone knows what is expected of a program)</em></li>
                    <li>Show the steps in a process as shapes,</li>
                    <li>Help to understand how a process works,</li>
                    <li>Identify potential problems or inefficiencies,</li>
                    <li>And can be used to Design Processes or Improve Existing Ones.</li>
                </ul>
                <br> To make your flow chart, you will likely use a software called: <strong>draw.io</strong>
                <br> <br> <strong><em>Here is an example of a Flow Chart:</em></strong>
                <br> <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; <img src="../../../images/flow-chart-example.png" alt="Example flow chart" width="300"/>
                <br> <strong>key features:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Makes use of several symbols
                        <br> &ensp; <em> (e.g: Decision Symbols, Process Symbols)</em> </li>
                    <li> Arrows to indicate the flow of the process,</li>
                    <li> Labels on decisions to clarify the flow,</li>
                    <li> Clear start and end points,</li>
                    <li> Easy to follow.</li>
                </ul>
            &ensp; <em><strong>Note:</strong> flow charts will be more complicated than the example... like <strong>waaaaay</strong> more complex...</em>

        <h3 id="marks-section">Marks?</h3>
        <p>Task 3 is worth 17 marks </p>

        <h3 id="time-section">Time?</h3>
        <p> You will have 3 Hours to complete this task</p>

        <h3 id="Tips"> Tips </h3>
        <p> 
            Some tips for Task 3:
            <ul>
                <li> Spend time <strong> getting familiar with draw.io </strong> before the exam.</li>
                <li> Make sure to <strong>read the task brief carefully</strong> and <strong>ensure you understand the requirements before begining anything else.</strong></li>
                <li> Use the data in the CSV file to help you meet the requirements of the brief.</li>
                <li> Do Not Overcomplicate things, keep your flow chart simple and easy to follow.</li>
            </ul>

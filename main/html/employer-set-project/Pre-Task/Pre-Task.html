        <p>
            The Pre-Task for the ESP introduces you to the business sector the ESP will revolve around (e.g: Retail, Real Estate, Fast Food etc.) which is useful as it can give you an idea of why the company might use digital tools/technologies.

            <li>Talk with other students
                <br>&ensp;<em>Generally, you will be in teams of six, however you can still communicate with those outside of your group.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Make notes about your research

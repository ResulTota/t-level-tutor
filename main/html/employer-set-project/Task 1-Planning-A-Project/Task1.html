        <h3 id="what-section">What Is It?</h3>
        <p> Task 1 is all about planning a project.
            <br> In the task, you will be a project manager for a software development company and you will be given a brief that you will use 
            to create the following:
            <ul>
                <li>a Gantt chart to manage the timeline of the project,</li>
                <li>a Resource & Cost Plan to demonstrate all costs,</li>
                <li>and a Rationale explaining your choices.</li>
            </ul>

            The brief will include information such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Project requirements,</li>
                <li>Deadlines,</li>
                <li>Tasks
                    <br> &ensp; <em>And the expected time the task will take </em></li>
                <li>Employee Information, </li>
                <li>Budget Constraints,</li>
                <li>Other relevant costs,
                    <br> &ensp; <em>(e.g: software licenses, hardware costs, staff training costs, etc.)</em></li>
                <li>And any other relevant information.</li>
            </ul>

            <em>Ok thats great, but what even is a gantt chart or a cost plan..?</em>

            <h4 id="Gantt Charts">Gantt Charts</h4>
            <p> A Gantt chart is a type of chart that illustrates a project schedule. It shows the start and finish dates of the various elements of a project. 
            <br><br> Gantt charts are useful for planning and scheduling projects, as they provide a visual representation of the timeline and help to identify many things
            <br> Such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Task Duration,</li>
                <li>Task Dependencies,</li>
                <li>and Resource allocation. <br> &ensp; <em>(Resource is another term for Employee)</em> </li>
            </ul>
            <strong><em>Here is an example of a Gantt chart:</em></strong>
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/gantt-chart-example.png" alt="Example Gantt Chart" width="600"/>
            <br> <strong>key features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tasks are listed on the left,</li>
                <li>Time is represented on the top,</li>
                <li>Start and End Date are also clearly displayed</li>
                <li>Bars represent the duration of each task,</li>
                <li>Dependencies between tasks are shown with black lines w/ arrows,</li>
                <li>Resources/ Employees responsible for a task are labelled next to it</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4 id="Resource & Cost Plan">Resource & Cost Plan</h4>
            <p> A Resource & Cost Plan is a document that outlines the resources required for a project and the associated costs.
            <br><br> It typically includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Human Resources: The employees needed for the project, including their roles and responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Material Resources: The physical items required for the project, such as equipment, software, and supplies.</li>
                <li>Financial Resources: The budget allocated for the project, including costs for human and material resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong><em>Here is an example of a resource & cost plan:</em></strong>
            <br> <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; <img src="../../../images/cost-plan-example.png" alt="Example Cost Plan" width="600"/>
            <br> <strong>key features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li> Tasks are clearly broken up </li>
                <li> Each task has a Resource allocated to it, along side their hourly rate</li>
                <li> The total hours and cost for each task is clearly displayed </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br> 

            <h4 id="Rationale">Rationale</h4>
            <p> A Rationale is a document that explains the reasoning behind the decisions made in a project.
            <br><br> It typically includes decisions such as:
            <ul>
                <li> Why did you choose a certain employee to do a task?
                    <br><em>e.g: why did you choose employee A to do Task 1 rather than employee B?</em></li>
                <li> Why did you allocate a certain amount of time to a task?
                    <br><em>e.g: why did you allocate 4 hours to Task 2 instead of 5 hours?</em></li>
                <li> Why did you choose to use a certain piece of software or hardware?
                    <br><em>e.g: why did you choose to use a cloud server over a physical one?</em></li>
                <li> Why did you choose to do tasks in a certain order?
                    <br><em>e.g: why did you choose to do Task 7 before Task 4?</em></li>
            </ul>
            <strong><em> You get the idea..</em></strong></li>
            </p>
            <br>

        <h3 id="Tips"> Tips </h3>
        <p> 
            Here are some tips to help you with this task:
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Do Not Neglect The Rationale.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is worth the most marks in the Task and you (almost certainly) <strong> will not </strong> have enough time to fully complete everything.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <li>Make sure to <strong>read the task brief carefully</strong> and <strong>ensure you understand the requirements before begining anything else.</strong></li>
                
                <li>Spend time <strong> getting familiar with tools </strong> used to create Gantt charts and Resource & Cost Plans <strong>before</strong> the exam.
                    <br> &ensp; <em> e.g: Ganttproject, Microsoft Project, Excel Spreadsheets etc.</em></li>
                
                <li>Be clear in your Rationale, take time to <strong>Fully explain</strong> why you made certain decisions.</li>
                
                <li>Do the tasks simultaneously, <strong>Do Not</strong> do the cost plan <strong>then</strong> the gantt chart <strong>then</strong> the rationale. 
                <br> <strong><em>You Will Not Finish In Time.</em></strong></li>
                
                <li>Check your work <strong> several times </strong> for accuracy and completeness before submitting.</li>
            </ul>

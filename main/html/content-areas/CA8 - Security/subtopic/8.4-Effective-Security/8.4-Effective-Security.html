        <p>
            <strong>The CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—forms the foundation of effective information security.</strong>
            <br>
            These three components are deeply interconnected:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protecting confidentiality</strong> helps maintain data integrity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ensuring integrity</strong> supports availability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            A weakness in one area can undermine the others, so a balanced approach is essential.
            <br>
            Understanding how these elements work together enables organisations to safeguard sensitive information, maintain trustworthiness, and ensure reliable access to data and systems.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Confidentiality:</strong>
                    <br>
                        Ensuring that data is kept private by controlling who has access to the data.
                        <br><em>
                        &emsp; <strong>Techniques:</strong> Encryption, access controls, authentication, data classification.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Benefits:</strong> Protects sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Drawbacks:</strong> May introduce complexity and reduce usability if not managed properly.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integrity:</strong>
                    <br>
                        Ensuring that the data has not been tampered with; this can be done by maintaining confidentiality.
                        <br>
                        <em>
                        &emsp; <strong>Techniques:</strong> Hashing, digital signatures, checksums, audit trails.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Benefits:</strong> Maintains trustworthiness and accuracy of data.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Can require additional resources and may impact performance.
                        </em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Availability:</strong>
                    <br>
                        Ensuring that data is available and useful; this can be done by ensuring integrity.
                        <br>
                        <em>
                        &emsp; <strong>Techniques:</strong> Redundancy, backups, failover systems, disaster recovery planning.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures users can access data and services when needed.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; <strong>Drawbacks:</strong> May increase costs and require ongoing maintenance.
                        </em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Relationship:</strong>
            <br>
                The CIA triad components support each other; for example, maintaining confidentiality helps protect integrity, and ensuring integrity supports availability. Weakness in one area can undermine the others.

        <h3 class="sub-heading" id="8.4.2">8.4.2 - Understand the processes and procedures that assure internet security and the reasons why they are used. </h3>
        <p>
            Understand the elements of the Identification, Authentication, Authorisation, Accountability (IAAA) model, including the techniques used, benefits, and drawbacks:
            <ul>

                    <li>Knowledge-based identification (e.g., username)</li>
                    <li>Possession-based identification (e.g., ID cards, tokens)</li>
                    <li>Biometric-based identification (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition)</li>
                </ul>
                &emsp; <strong>Benefits:</strong> Enables systems to distinguish between users and apply appropriate controls.
                <br>
                &emsp; <strong>Drawbacks:</strong> May be vulnerable to impersonation or theft of credentials/devices.
                </em>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Authentication:</strong>
                <br>

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Authorisation:</strong>
                <br>
                Ensuring that authenticated users can only access resources and perform actions they are permitted to.

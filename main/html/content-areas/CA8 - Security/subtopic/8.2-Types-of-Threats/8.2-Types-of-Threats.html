            <p>
                Technical threats refer to various cyber threats that can compromise the security, integrity, and availability of systems and data. 
                <br>Common technical threats include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software that can damage or disrupt systems. 
                        <br> &emsp; <em> <strong>Examples:</strong>  viruses, worms, key loggers, ransomware, spyware, trojans.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>DoS Attacks:</strong> Denial of Service attacks are when one computer overwhelms a system with traffic, making it unavailable to users. 
                        <br> &emsp; <em> (Distributed Denial of Service [DDoS] attacks are DoS attacks that come from several computers)</em></li>
                    <li><strong>BotNets:</strong> Networks of compromised computers controlled by attackers to launch large-scale attacks or spread malware.
                        <br> &emsp; <em> <strong>Example Usages:</strong> Used for DDoS attacks, spamming, and distributing malware.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Hackers:</strong> Individuals or groups who attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
                        <br> &emsp; <em> <strong>Example Usages:</strong> Can exploit vulnerabilities to steal, alter, or destroy information.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
                        <br> &emsp; <em> <strong>Examples:</strong> phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity, often via email.
                        <br> &emsp; <em> <strong>Example Usages:</strong> Can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized access to systems.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Insecure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):</strong> APIs that lack proper security controls can be exploited to access or manipulate data.
                    <li><strong>Man-In-The-Middle attacks:</strong> Attackers intercept and potentially alter communications between two parties without their knowledge.
                    <li><strong>Open/Unsecured Wi-Fi networks:</strong> Public or poorly secured wireless networks can be exploited by attackers to intercept data or gain unauthorized access.
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading" id="8.2.2">8.2.2 - Understand potential technical vulnerabilities to systems and data: </h3>
        <p>
            Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses in systems, software, or processes that can be exploited by attackers to compromise security. 
            <br><strong>Common technical vulnerabilities include:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inadequate Security Processes:</strong> Poorly implemented or missing security procedures can leave systems exposed.
                    <br> &emsp; <em>
                        <strong>Examples:</strong> Lack of regular security audits, insufficient monitoring, failure to update security policies.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Weak Encryption:</strong> Using outdated or easily broken encryption algorithms makes data susceptible to interception and theft.
                    <br> &emsp; <em>
                        <strong>Example Usages:</strong> Transmitting sensitive information over unsecured channels, storing passwords with weak hashes.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Inadequate Password Policy:</strong> Allowing weak, easily guessable passwords or not enforcing password changes increases risk of unauthorized access.
                    <br> &emsp; <em>
                        <strong>Examples:</strong> No minimum password length, no complexity requirements, passwords reused across accounts.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Failure to Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Relying solely on passwords makes accounts more vulnerable to compromise.
                    <br> &emsp; <em>
                        <strong>Example Usages:</strong> Sensitive accounts accessible with only a password, no additional verification steps.
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Out-of-Date Components:</strong> Using outdated hardware, software, or firmware can introduce vulnerabilities due to lack of support or unpatched security flaws.
                    <br> &emsp; <em>
                        <strong>Examples:</strong> Unsupported operating systems, legacy applications, unpatched zero-day bugs, obsolete firmware.
                    </em>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

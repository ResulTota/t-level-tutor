    <h4>Sales and Marketing:</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Better market research</h4>
        <p>Digital tools such as <strong>online surveys, customer feedback systems, and analytics</strong> allow organisations 
        to understand customer needs and identify <strong>market trends</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Better brand promotion, including social media</h4>
        <p>Platforms such as <strong>Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn</strong> allow businesses to <strong>promote products</strong> and 
        engage with <strong>wider audiences</strong> more cost-effectively.</p>
    

        <h4>Online selling</h4>
        <p>E-commerce websites and marketplaces (e.g., <strong>Amazon, Shopify</strong>) provide organisations with the 
        ability to sell goods and services <strong>24/7</strong> worldwide.</p>

        <h4>Contextualising customer behaviour to personalise services offered</h4>
        <p>By using <strong>customer data</strong>, organisations can provide <strong>personalised recommendations</strong>, targeted 
        advertisements, and customised offers to increase satisfaction and sales.</p>

        <h4>Better customer retention</h4>
        <p>Through <strong>loyalty programs, CRM systems, and personalised communication</strong>, businesses can build 
        <strong>long-term relationships</strong> with their customers.</p>

        <h4>Brand differentiation and values</h4>
        <p>Digital platforms allow companies to emphasise <strong>unique values</strong> such as <strong>innovation</strong>, 
        <strong>sustainability</strong>, or <strong>customer service</strong> to stand out from competitors.</p>

        <h4>Use of analytic tools, including search and social media analytics</h4>
        <p>Analytics tools like <strong>Google Analytics</strong> and <strong>social media insights</strong> help organisations track 
        <strong>engagement, customer behaviour, and marketing success</strong>.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Research, Design and Development:</h4>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>Digital prototyping, simulations, and customer feedback tools</strong> allow the creation of 
        <strong>unique, innovative products and services</strong> tailored to market needs.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Human Resources:</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Staff records</h4>
        <p>HR systems store <strong>employee data securely</strong> for easy access and compliance with laws.</p>

        <h4>Performance management</h4>
        <p>Digital performance tools help track <strong>employee achievements, goals, and reviews</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Training records</h4>
        <p>Organisations use <strong>e-learning platforms</strong> and HR databases to manage <strong>training progress and certifications</strong>.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Operations:</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Enhanced internal communication</h4>
        <p>Messaging and video platforms (e.g., <strong>Slack, Teams</strong>) improve communication across teams.</p>

        <h4>Automation of internal processes</h4>
        <p>Digital systems <strong>automate routine tasks</strong> such as payroll, scheduling, and reporting.</p>

        <h4>Automated manufacturing</h4>
        <p>Robotics and <strong>computer-controlled machinery</strong> increase productivity and reduce errors.</p>

        <h4>Remote working</h4>
        <p>Cloud systems and video conferencing tools allow <strong>flexible working</strong> from any location.</p>

        <h4>Intranet/shared workspace</h4>
        <p>Provides staff with <strong>centralised access</strong> to company documents, policies, and news.</p>

        <h4>Document sharing and online shared storage</h4>
        <p>Cloud services like <strong>Google Drive</strong> and <strong>SharePoint</strong> enable <strong>real-time collaboration</strong> 
        on documents.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Management:</h4>
    <p>Managers benefit from <strong>real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs)</strong> including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sales</strong> – live dashboards showing current revenue performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Customers served</strong> – instant tracking of service and support activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Units manufactured</strong> – automated counters showing production output.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time location of assets</strong> – GPS and IoT systems for tracking equipment or vehicles.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Logistics:</h4>
    <p><strong>Automated stock control systems</strong> track inventory levels, send reorder alerts, and reduce errors 
    caused by manual entry.</p>


    <h4>Finance:</h4>
    <ul>
    <h4>Reduced costs</h4>
    <p>Automation and digital workflows reduce <strong>labour costs and operational inefficiencies</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Increased revenue</h4>
    <p>Digital sales platforms and better <strong>customer targeting</strong> help expand revenue streams.</p>

    <h4>Better financial reporting via up-to-date information</h4>
    <p>Real-time accounting software ensures <strong>accurate financial insights</strong>, aiding faster decision-making.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="sub-heading" id="5.2.2">5.2.2 - Understand how digital systems are used to meet user needs and ensure quality of product/service</h3>

    <h4>Appropriate and Effective Functionality</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Digital systems must have the right functions so users can complete all required tasks.</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Microsoft Word allows users to type, edit, format, and share documents. If the system lacked these, users would struggle to meet their needs.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Reduction of Pain Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Response Time</h4>
        <p>Systems should respond quickly, or at least communicate expected wait times.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Google Drive shows a progress bar when uploading files.</p>

        <h4>Complexity of Task</h4>
        <p>Tasks should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Amazon provides one-click purchasing to reduce complexity.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Appropriate Accessibility Provision</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Systems must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Screen readers, captions, and high-contrast options allow broader use.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Compatibility</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>With Internal Legacy Systems</h4>
        <p>New systems should work with older systems still in use.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A payroll system pulling data from an old HR database.</p>

        <h4>With Proposed Future Systems</h4>
        <p>Systems should integrate with upcoming technologies.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A CRM designed to later connect with AI analytics tools.</p>

        <h4>With External Services</h4>
        <p>Must integrate with third-party services.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An e-commerce platform linking with PayPal and shipping providers.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Availability of Service</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Minimise Downtime</h4>
        <p>Reliable systems should stay available as much as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> AWS uses backup servers to reduce outages.</p>

        <h4>Future Proofing for Upgrades</h4>
        <p>Systems should allow for updates without disrupting users.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Software that installs updates overnight to avoid downtime.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Effective End User Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Users should have help through guides, FAQs, or chat support.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Apple offers online chat, tutorials, and forums for support.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ease of Installation</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Systems should be simple to install with minimal effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Mobile apps install in one click; larger software includes setup packages with documentation.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">5.2.2 - Understand how digital systems are used to meet user needs and ensure quality of product/service</h3>

    <h4>Appropriate and Effective Functionality</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Digital systems must have the right functions so users can complete all required tasks.</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Microsoft Word allows users to type, edit, format, and share documents. If the system lacked these, users would struggle to meet their needs.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Reduction of Pain Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Response Time</h4>
        <p>Systems should respond quickly, or at least communicate expected wait times.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Google Drive shows a progress bar when uploading files.</p>

        <h4>Complexity of Task</h4>
        <p>Tasks should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Amazon provides one-click purchasing to reduce complexity.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Appropriate Accessibility Provision</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Systems must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Screen readers, captions, and high-contrast options allow broader use.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Compatibility</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>With Internal Legacy Systems</h4>
        <p>New systems should work with older systems still in use.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A payroll system pulling data from an old HR database.</p>

        <h4>With Proposed Future Systems</h4>
        <p>Systems should integrate with upcoming technologies.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A CRM designed to later connect with AI analytics tools.</p>

        <h4>With External Services</h4>
        <p>Must integrate with third-party services.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An e-commerce platform linking with PayPal and shipping providers.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Availability of Service</h4>
    <ul>
        <h4>Minimise Downtime</h4>
        <p>Reliable systems should stay available as much as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> AWS uses backup servers to reduce outages.</p>

        <h4>Future Proofing for Upgrades</h4>
        <p>Systems should allow for updates without disrupting users.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Software that installs updates overnight to avoid downtime.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Effective End User Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Users should have help through guides, FAQs, or chat support.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Apple offers online chat, tutorials, and forums for support.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ease of Installation</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Systems should be simple to install with minimal effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Mobile apps install in one click; larger software includes setup packages with documentation.</p>
    </ul>
